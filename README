+ The basic idea is to try to provide an interface for drawing
  more artistic curves that vary in their width

  - Adobe Illustrator has pressure-sensitive stylus support
    for free-hand drawing

    + here's a nice video of the "width" tool that allows 
      editing of variable width at different points on a stroke

      - NOTE that this allows different widths "above" and "below" the line

    + there is a scripting API for AI, but may not provide access to
      all tools, e.g., cannot find example of script control of width tool

  - Inkscape does not have support ?

  - there are some proposals for SVG/CSS support

    https://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/WG/wiki/Proposals/Variable_width_stroke

  - no support in processing(.js) ?
